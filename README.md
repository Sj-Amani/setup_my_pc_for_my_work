## Procedure
### Make "app" folder:
A good habbit is to keep all the "git" cloned folder in a directory named **app**. I usually keep it under my home directory.
1.  `mkdir /home/$USER/app`.

### Setup Nvidia Driver and Reboot PC:
1. Activities ðŸ¡’ Software & Updates ðŸ¡’ Additional Drivers ðŸ¡’ Using Nvidia driver metapackage from nvidia-driver-470 (open source/proprietary , better to use latest tested one) ðŸ¡’ Apply Changes ðŸ¡’ Restart PC
2. Also, if there is a part said "Intel Corporation: Unknown". You can ignore it.
